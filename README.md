✍️ What I Learned or applied
This project helped me:

🔐 Learn and apply authentication using Supabase Auth

📦 Created a simple Express.js backend with secure routes

🔄 Implemented full CRUD operations 

🎨 Build a focused and niche UI/UX for anime/manga fans

🧠 Understand user-based data isolation (foreign keys, access control)

🧪 Use Postman for API testing

🗃️ Use Supabase as a lightweight but powerful hosted PostgreSQL database

📚 Future Improvements
Add search and filter by genre, status, or rating

Support for image uploads

Add light/dark mode toggle

Let users track both anime and manga separately
